# 🚢 Ship Performance Optimization Using DMAIC

**Author:** K.S. Manjunath  
**Type:** Six Sigma Black Belt Project (Simulated with Kaggle-inspired data)  
**Tools Used:** Minitab, Excel, DMAIC Methodology

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project aims to reduce **Turnaround Time (TAT)** and optimize **operational efficiency** across different ship types using Lean Six Sigma DMAIC methodology. Simulated datasets and root cause analytics were used to identify, analyze, and resolve key inefficiencies in shipping operations.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Reduce TAT below 60 hours
- Improve fuel efficiency (nm/kWh)
- Optimize scheduling and reduce unplanned downtime
- Enhance predictive maintenance

## 📊 DMAIC Highlights

| Phase     | Summary |
|-----------|---------|
| Define    | VOC analysis, CTQ identified, high cost & delay root causes |
| Measure   | Normality test, I-MR charts, DPMO = 208,668, Sigma ~2.0 |
| Analyze   | Pareto chart, Fishbone diagram, ANOVA + Hypothesis tests |
| Improve   | AI-based scheduling, predictive maintenance, skill optimization |
| Control   | Paired t-test confirmed success, process stabilized, Cpk = 1.00 |

## 📈 Key Outcomes

- TAT reduced from 41.74 → 38.05 hours (p < 0.05)
- 10–15% cost reduction estimated
- Strategy validated with statistical significance

## 🧠 Business Value

Even with simulated data, this project mimics real-world operational inefficiencies and shows how **DMAIC + analytics** can:
- Drive cost reduction
- Improve predictive reliability
- Deliver data-driven continuous improvement
